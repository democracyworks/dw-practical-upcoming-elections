# Democracy Works Upcoming Elections Practical Exercise

Thank you for applying to work at Democracy Works! This coding
exercise is designed to show off your ability to program a small
application that interacts with an API. You should spend not more than
2 hours on it and then turn it in to us.

If you've previously applied to Democracy Works with this project,
we ask that you either 1) submit the work you completed previously, or 2)
start your work from scratch so that we can fairly judge your work
against that of other applicants.

## The project

You are building a web application that can tell people what elections
they have coming up based on their address. It is similar to the kinds
of things you'd be working on at Democracy Works and uses one of our
APIs.

When someone visits the site you create, they will be presented with
an address form. When the user submits the form, your code will
translate the address into some OCD-IDs (see below), query the
Democracy Works Elections API for upcoming elections for those
OCD-IDs, and display to the user any elections returned.

## Our grading rubric

We evaluate submissions according to the following criteria:

* The form submits
* State and place OCD-IDs are correctly generated
* The Democracy Works Elections API is called correctly
* Returned elections are displayed to the user
* The results are formatted for the user
* The code that generates OCD-IDs can be easily changed
* The project has documentation
* There are tests
* Functions/classes/methods are small and clearly scoped
* Names are clear

The goal is to see that you can get some working code that is readable
to others. We do not expect you to complete everything on this list,
nor is this list exhaustive of what would go into a "real" project
(there is no consideration for failure cases or deployment, for
example).

## The anonymous review

In order to reduce potential bias, your submission will be graded
anonymously. To make that easier, please don't include any personally
identifying information in your code or documentation.

To avoid using your own address in documentation or tests, you can use
well-known places (like the White House or Disneyland) or the
Democracy Works office in Brooklyn (20 Jay St, Brooklyn, NY 11201).

## Project templates

Project templates exist for [Clojure][clojure-template],
[JavaScript][javascript-template], and [Python][python-template]. You
may choose another language, or choose to not work from these
templates. If you choose to not use a template, be sure to document
how to run your project.

Pick a language that you're comfortable in. There are no bonus points
for making a particular choice here.

The templates include some libraries for HTTP routing and HTML
templating. You are encouraged to add dependencies as needed.

## About OCD-IDs

OCD-IDs are [Open Civic Data division identifiers][ocd-ids] and they
look like this (for the state of Massachusetts):
`ocd-division/country:us/state:ma`

A given address can be associated with several OCD-IDs. For example,
an address in Wayland, Massachusetts would be associated with the
following OCD-IDs:

* `ocd-division/country:us`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/cd:5`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/county:middlesex`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/place:wayland`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/sldl:13th_middlesex`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/sldu:norfolk_bristol_and_middlesex`

Not all of those are derivable from just the text of an address. For
example, merely having an address in Wayland doesn't tell us what
county it is in; we would have to query a system that understands how
addresses relate to counties.

But we can derive a basic set of state and place (i.e. city) OCD-IDs
that will be a good starting point for this project. This entails...

* creating the state OCD-ID by lower-casing the state abbreviation and
  appending it to `ocd-division/country:us/state:`
* creating a copy of the state OCD-ID
* appending `/place:` to it
* lower-casing the city value, replacing all spaces with underscores,
  and appending it to that

So, the city "Wayland" and the state "MA" would result in the OCD-IDs:

* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma`
* `ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/place:wayland`

Then you should supply both OCD-IDs to your election API request,
separated by a comma as shown in the example URL below.

    https://api.turbovote.org/elections/upcoming?district-divisions=ocd-division/country:us/state:ma,ocd-division/country:us/state:ma/place:wayland

## About the API

The upcoming elections API endpoint lives at
`https://api.turbovote.org/elections/upcoming`. You'll make `GET`
requests to it.

You'll need to supply a query string with a `district-divisions`
key. Its value should be comma-delimited OCD-IDs. See the example
above.

The response will be in the [EDN format][edn] (commonly used in
Clojure) by default, but you can request JSON by setting your
request's Accept header to `application/json` if you prefer.

The API is not configured for [CORS][cors], so you won't be able to
make requests from the user's browser. You'll have to have a server
process to make those requests. The provided templates have you
covered.

## Current elections

Depending on the time of year and whether it's an odd or even-numbered
year, the number of elections in the system can vary wildly. We
maintain an [up-to-date list of OCD-IDs that will return an
election][upcoming-elections] until the dates they are listed
under. Please refer to that for example OCD-IDs that will return an
election to your app.
